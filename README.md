# malmo-project

## How to run:
command: python main.py -a [Random/Simple/Realistic] -n [num-of-executions]
## Dependencies

To run this project you will need:
* [Python 2.7 64-bit](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2713/)
* [Malmo 0.30](https://github.com/Microsoft/malmo/releases)
* Setup `AIMA_PATH`, `MALMO_ROOT`, `MALMO_XSD_PATH` & `JAVA_HOME` to the correct directories (this can be done in the user environment variables if you don't want to clutter the system environment variables)
* Install the necessary python modules by running `pip install numpy matplotlib networkx` (If you're on Windows, you might need to be an shell with Administrator privileges)
* Open up Minecraft by running `launchClient.bat` found in MALMO_ROOT\\Minecraft\\
* Open another shell and run `python main.py`

## Possible issues and resolution
* If you're getting DDL %1 load failed, you probably have a 32-bit version of python, you can check this in a shell by typing `python --version`
* If `import MalmoPython` is failing, there is an path issue. A workaround for this is to copy MalmoPython.pyp & MalmoPython.lib over to your working directory
